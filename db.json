A one-pot dish, super quick to make, no frying, just a bit of boiling, and the flexibility of the dish is on par with fried rice! You could put pretty much anything into the soup, and you can also choose any BBQ sauce of your liking or make one yourself with just 4 ingredients. Also, it's freakishly delicious and addictive.",

Also, if you want the buns warm and a bit roasted, like we do, try putting them into an oven in 400°F for 4 minutes, or into a toaster, or fry them in the burger pan for a minute each."
